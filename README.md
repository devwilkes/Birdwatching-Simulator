# Birdwatching Simulator
A game about watching birds! Uses third-person overworld navigation as well as first-person camera functions to allow the player to flip between exploring massive landscapes and taking pictures. Uses inspiration from Pokemon Snap gameplay, but adds free roaming on a big map. More maps, visual changes, and mechanics are planned for the future.
Created by Devon Wilkes, with assistance and input by Brittany Steiner, Will Miller, and Barry Caudill.
